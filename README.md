# configger

configger wants to be a scalable, versatile and light weight configuration file manager for linux

  - track configuration files for changes
  - differential backups with version control and history
  - filesets and taxonomy
  - migration tools for copying over configuration files to other servers
  - remote monitoring and rapid deployment

### Current status

configger has barely got off the ground. There's a working file tracker, and a command line interface for adding and removing files from the tracker. I'm an ambitious person.

### Todos

 - tracker as a class
 - run as a service
 - implement tracker-cli to manage service
 - implement autobackup
